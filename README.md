# Robo-Weekend
Obv this repo needs WAY better documentation but its fiiiiine we ball - I'll fill in more info as we go! :)

Install list:
1. VSCode
2. Python (honestly don't think the version matters since we're coding in micropython)
3. VSCode pi pico extension (side bar on VSCode has an image of a couple squares stacked on top of one another - go there and type "Pi Pico" in. There will be a plugin that's made by microsoft. Install it!)

## Working with Pi Pico
VSCode's extension for Pi Pico makes working with pico embedded systems so much easier. Clone this repo, then open in vscode with the extension installed and it will auto-boot into a pi pico project. Plug in your pico and it will auto detect it. In order to run your files on the pico, r-click on a file and select "Run current file on Pico". Note that if you ever hit control-c while a program is running, the pi needs to be restarted (unplug & replug, or disconnect & reconnect)
